                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives 
                        users access to millions of songs and content from creators all over 
                        the world. Created in 2006, it is currently one of the largest music 
                        streaming platforms available, with over 433 million monthly active 
                        users, including 188 million paying subscribers, as of June 2022. 
                        Spotify allows users to create playlists (individual or group),
                        follow other users, share content with other platforms, and even 
                        provides playlists curated for them by AI. The primary function of 
                        this app, listening to music, podcasts, etc., is done well in the 
                        app, but there are some features that deserve more attention. The 
                        Spotify Social feature, which I am focusing on for this case study, 
                        includes User Profiles and a Sidebar, only on Desktop, to view what 
                        your friends are listening to.

                        <h2>Defining Users and Goals</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The users of the Spotify app come 
                            from all different backgrounds, ages, countries, 
                            genders, etc., so it is crucial that the app is catered 
                            to all walks of life. For this group of users, I decided 
                            to survey men and women between the ages of 19-22 and 50-60 
                            to get data from younger and older generations. The surveyed 
                            individuals are all Spotify premium users but have had some 
                            experience with Soundcloud and Apple Music.</p>

                      <h2>Application Analysis</h2>
                      <p class="lead">The Spotify App has almost every feature a music-lover could want
                         from a streaming platform. Spotify uses an algorithm to suggest and
                          create curated playlists for users, in addition to offering company-created 
                          playlists. Spotify also offers a small social feature – but not many users 
                          know about it. On the desktop app, users can see what their friends are 
                          listening to and when they were last active on the righthand side of the screen. 
                          On the mobile app, this feature is not present, though users can view friends' 
                          profiles and playlists through the search bar or via their following list. Many 
                          users do not know this feature exists, but if they did, it would change the way 
                          they interact with the app.</p>

                        <h2>User Research</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The participants in this study were 25 male and female Spotify Premium 
                            users who’s ages ranged from 19-60 years-old. The users were surveyed via social media 
                            using a google form with 15 questions. When asked what spotify features they use least, 
                            71.4% of users said the social feature. When asked questions about spotify social features, 
                            many users said that they had no idea it even existed, whereas about 10% of surveyed users 
                            said they had used the feature previously. When asked what features they wished Spotify Social 
                            had, users stated that they wished there was a easier, centralized way to share music with 
                            friends in the app. Format-wise, users noted that the desktop sidebar feature is convenient, 
                            but a feed-style format could be better for music-sharing.</p> 

 

                         <p class="lead">Most users main frustration with the social feature was that it is not highlighted enough on 
                            the app, nor does it have a visually-appealing interface design. More than 50% of users said 
                            they would be comfortable sharing information such as First and Last Name, Username, Pronouns, 
                            Top 5 Artists of the Month, Current Song Playing, Profile Biography, and Top 5 Songs of the 
                            Month. I was surprised to see only 46.4% of users said they were comfortable with other users 
                            seeing their last active time, since this is already a feature of Spotify Social. When asked 
                            how helpful an updated social feature for spotify would be, many users stated that they would 
                            use spotify regardless of a social feature, but feel that it would help boost interaction 
                            within the Spotify community. I also asked if users thought "like" and "comment" features 
                            should be included, and while some users thought it could be an interesting idea, most users 
                            said that it would feel judgemental to have likes and comments on their music taste. Users also 
                            noted that a Direct Messaging system should not be included, but a feed to post playlists to, 
                            should be.</p>

                        <h2>Design Problem Statement</h2>
                        <h3>Pain Point #1: Social Feature Visibility</h3>
                        <p class="lead">As backed by my research, most users main frustration 
                            with the social feature was that it is not highlighted enough on the app, 
                            nor does it have a visually-appealing interface design. Surveyed users said 
                            the social feature is "hard to find" and has minimal functionality.</p>

                            <h3>Pain Point #2: Sharing Capabilities</h3>
                            <p class="lead">When asked what features they think a Spotify Social feature 
                                should have, users noted that there weren't many options to share music/playlists 
                                within the app. It was suggested by several users, that a feed where users can 
                                post songs and playlisys would remedy this pain point.</p>

                                <h3>Pain Point #3: Finding Friends/Profiles</h3>
                            <p class="lead">Users also stated that they struggle to find friends' profiles. 
                                One user said she struggles to find other users even when she types their 
                                username into the search bar. Users noted that the Spotify Social feature 
                                would be improved by making it easier to find friends and discover other 
                                users.</p>

                                <h2>The Design Problem</h2>
                                <p class="lead">All three pain points can be successfully remedied through my redesign. 
                                    However, as proven by my research, visibility, sharing capabilities, and finding friends, 
                                    are critical factors that influence the use of the social feature. The main problem is the 
                                    visibility of the features, since many users (54%) did not know the social feature existed.
                                     With a highly visible social feature, 71% of users said they would use it to share playlists 
                                     with friends (in a feed-style approach) and find new music through what friends are listening 
                                     to. It was highly agreed upon amongst 79.4% of users that the social feature should not 
                                     include a direct messaging system or capabilities to “Like” or “Comment” on what a user is 
                                     listening to.</p>

                                     <h4>This leads us to our Design Question:</h4>
                                     <p class="lead">How might we improve the experience of Spotify Users utilizing the social feature in the Canvas app?</p>

                        <h2>The Redesign</h2>
                        <p class="lead">During my user research, I asked students how they would change the Spotify 
                            Social Feature in order to improve their overall experience. I received many responses to 
                            this question stating that users have never used the social feature and some did not know it 
                            existed. However, 46% of users stated they had used the feature, and noted that increased 
                            visibility, sharing capabilities, and a new interface design, would boost the app’s overall 
                            interactability and user experience.</p>
                            
                            <h2>The Design Solution</h2>
                            <p class="lead">To solve this design problem, there should be a tab on the main navigation that 
                                takes users to the social feature. This would solve the visibility problem and would provide 
                                a fast way of getting to the social feature. In addition, shared playlists and current listening 
                                status will be found in a feed-style layout. Users can share playlists and what they’re listening 
                            to with everyone, or just a few of their friends on the social feed. There will also be an option within 
                            the feature to sync your contacts so users can easily find their friends in one place.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class="lead">It was very interesting to me how not only had most users not used the 
                        Spotify Social feature, but most users did not know it even existed. 12.2% of users 
                        stated they hadn’t used the feature, while 53.7% of users said they had no idea this 
                        feature existed. In the future, I hope to test my solution to see if it really would 
                        improve the experience of spotify users interacting within the app. This project 
                        helped me practice and hone my prototyping and wireframing skills as well as critical 
                        thinking skills during the user research stage. This app redesign made me realize how 
                        important Product/UX Design is, for even the smallest features.</p>
